#### $ WhoAmI?
I'm Shahrokh (/ʃɑ:hroʊk/), but usually go by "shah" and "Sean" 😉

<p align="justify">
Currently, I’m a PhD candidate in <a href="https://www.cse.gatech.edu/people/shahrokh-shahi" target="_blank">Computer Science/Computational Science and Engineering (CSE)</a> in the College of Computing at Georgia Institute of Technology. Prior to starting my PhD, I did two master’s degrees; one in Computer Science from <a href="http://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/" target="_blank">Imperial College London</a> and another in Structural Engineering from University of Tehran. My PhD research is mainly focused on developing Deep Learning algorithms, Reservoir Computing techniques, and data-driven approaches to build reliable predictive models for complex time series forecasting.

Aside from research, I have loved writing codes for entire of my life and had the experience of developing softwares in almost any programming language most people are aware of, such as C++, Python, Java, MATLAB, JS, Julia, and a bunch of others that most people may never heard of, such as Fortran, Perl, Prolog, and even Assembly (Yeah! I know!😅 but it was not rare back in the day when QBasic and Pascal were still taught in elementary schools)

#### $ What's the plan?
<p align="justify">
For a long time in my life, I've been using many different version control platforms including Github, GitLab, and BitBucket, and had various personal and enterprise accounts. But finally decided to stick with the sweet GitHub and migrate everything to here!
</p>

<p align="justify">
I have also started to organize my codes and release them. More information is available in my <a href="https://www.sshahi.com/" target="_blank">personal website</a>, where the <a href="https://www.sshahi.com/projects/" target="_blank">project</a> section demonstrates a growing collection of the projects I've ever worked on. Moreover, the <a href="https://www.sshahi.com/downloads/" target="_blank">Download</a> and <a href="https://www.sshahi.com/teaching/" target="_blank">Teaching</a> sections provide descriptions and links to the source codes of the packages and toolboxes that I've ever developed.
